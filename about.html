      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Climbiz Solutions is a dual-impact startup based in Turkana County, Kenya. We empower SMEs and rural communities through climate-smart technologies and digital business tools—because climate resilience and entrepreneurship must go hand in hand.
Problem.
Kenya’s 7.4 million SMEs face climate risks, poor digital infrastructure, and limited access to sustainable technology. In arid regions like Turkana, these challenges are even more severe. Youth unemployment and low climate awareness make it harder for communities to adapt and grow.
.</p>
      <p><h5>Market & Competition</h5>
We are targeting underserved SMEs across Kenya, starting in Turkana. Unlike solar-only players like SunCulture or M-KOPA, Climbiz offers bundled solutions that combine tech, training, and market access—positioning us in the value-add services layer.
</p>
      <p><h5>Product & Go-to-Market</h5>
Our first mobile platform will be launched in Q1 2026. We have piloted in Lokichar, onboarded 30+ SMEs, and built strong local partnerships. We scale through youth-led outreach, NGO collaboration, and regional hubs for support and distribution.
<h5>Business Model & Financials </h5>
We generate revenue through product sales, SaaS subscriptions, training fees, and co-funded programs. Our monthly recurring revenue is KES 820,000 (~USD $6,200), with strong margins and a growing customer base.
         <h5>Traction & Team </h5>
We have trained 500+ youth, secured local partnerships, and built a team of 8—led by founders with deep experience in climate tech and SME development. Our mobile app is in development, and demand is growing fast.
Use of Funds-We are seeking KES 6 million to launch our app, expand to 3 new counties, train 500 more youth, and onboard 200+ SMEs. With your support, Climbiz will become Kenya’s leading climate-business catalyst—transforming lives and livelihoods across the country.
